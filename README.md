# 🐍 Snake Game

A classic Snake Game built with Python, inspired by an [Udemy tutorial playlist](https://www.udemy.com/share/103J8C3@3PNqbmT_GkK2OOCVkoGpO0Ot6m_j5MPkRf-GZx5l-oacYnTMTi2vfedF5OAKHioBdw==/). This project was created as part of my learning journey in python developer, with several personal modifications.

---

## ✨ Technologies

- Python 3  
- Turtle 
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

## 🚀 Features

- Classic Snake Gameplay – Control the snake to eat food and grow longer  
- Score System – Track your current score during gameplay  
- Collision Detection – Game ends when hitting walls or itself  
- Smooth Controls – Responsive keyboard movement  
- Custom Modifications – Adjusted mechanics and structure from the original tutorial

## 📍 The Process

This project was developed while learning from an Udemy tutorial playlist  ["the 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/20889944#overview) about building games with Python and Pygame. I followed the main concepts and structure from the course, then modified several parts to better understand how the game works internally.

Through this project, I learned how to handle game loops, user input, collision detection, and basic game logic. Making small improvements and adjustments helped me deepen my understanding of Python and game development.

## 🎯 Project Structure

- `main.py` – Main game loop and core logic  
- `snake.py` – Snake movement and behavior  
- `food.py` – Food generation system  
- `scoreboard.py` – Score display and tracking  
- `settings.py` – Game configuration (if available)

*(Structure may vary depending on implementation)*
